### Idea

Pet owners, especially when the pets are adopted, do not have a means to identify what type of breed their pets are. Our app will provide services for pets, specifically dogs, to be matched with their breed. That way, pet owners know more about their pets and love them more. This project fits the design theme of this year because none of our team members own pets. Furthermore, college students do not tend to own any pets. So we are indeed designing for people that are different from us.
